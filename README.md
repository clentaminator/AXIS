## Introduction
axIS isn't just a nameâ€”it's a journey, a community, and a vision. Emerging from the intersecting axes of graphing, our organization stands at the crossroads of knowledge and innovation. We are the axis where theoretical learning meets practical application, where student potential ignites community transformation. At axIS, we are dedicated to nurturing the next generation of Information Systems leaders. We champion student excellence, foster dynamic community engagement, and drive groundbreaking innovation. As we navigate our academic paths, we do so with a shared purpose: to create a future where technology and human ingenuity come together to shape a better world.

## Logo Variation
### 1. Primary Logo
- The primary logo consists of the axIS wordmark with the tagline "Where Potential Meets Impact" integrated underneath.
### 2. Secondary Logo
- The secondary logo includes the axIS wordmark without the tagline for more compact uses.
### 3. Logomark
- The logomark features a simplified design of the crossroad symbol, suitable for small-scale applications like favicons or social media profile pictures.
### 4. Logotype
- The logotype is the visual representation of axIS and should be used thoughtfully to ensure brand consistency and recognition.
